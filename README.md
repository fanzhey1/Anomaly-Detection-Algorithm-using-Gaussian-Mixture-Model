# Anomaly-Detection-Algorithm-using-Gaussian-Mixture-Model

*This project is adapted from an assignment from APS1070 at University of Toronto.*

The purpose of this project is to train multiple Gaussian mixture models to classify fraud transactions from credit card transactions dataset (over 280,000 observations), models include one or multiple Gaussian models with single or multiple features. This dataset contains 28 key features, which are not directly interpretable but contain meaningful information about the dataset.

Model evaluation metrics: AUC, recall, precision, F1-score, accuracy.
